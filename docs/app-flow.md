# App Flow Spec — 10,000hours.com

This section documents the end-to-end user journeys, screens, states, and data exchanged between front-end and API.

---

## Entities & Concepts
- **Category**: user-defined label with color + type. Some categories are flagged Counts Toward Mastery.
- **Session (Log)**: contiguous time block with `start`, `end`, `durationMin`, `categoryId`, `title`, optional `quality` 1–5, `tags`, `noteId`?.
- **Note**: free text, optionally linked to one or more sessions.
- **Summary**: precomputed day/week/month totals for fast Insights.
- **Skill Pace**: projection toward 10,000 quality-weighted hours for categories marked as “skill.”

## Route Map (Next.js)

```
/                 (Landing)
/app              (Authenticated shell)
/app/now          (Timer / Quick Log)
/app/timeline     (Day/Week views)
/app/insights     (Analytics)
/app/notes        (Notes list + editor)
/app/categories   (Manage categories)
/app/settings     (Profile, preferences, data)
```

---

## Onboarding (First Run)
1. Welcome → CTA “create my space”.
2. Timezone detected; allow change.
3. Starter Categories
   - Preload suggestions (Sleep, Food, Coding, CS Girlies, Friends, God, Exercise, Social Media Posts).
   - User adds/edits colors; sets Type and Counts Toward Mastery.
4. Targets (optional): weekly targets for chosen skills.
5. Import (optional): CSV (sleep), ICS (calendar) preview screen.
6. Finish → lands on Timer with a short guided tooltip tour.

**Edge Cases**
- Skip creates minimal set (Sleep, Food, General).
- If import creates overlaps, queue “resolve overlaps” banner linking to Timeline.

---

## Logging Time

### A) Live Log (Timer)
- **Inputs**: category (default last used), title, tags.
- **Start Logging**: creates a running session (`start`=now, `end`=null).
- **In-progress actions**:
  - add note (auto-link to running session)
  - adjust time ±1/5 min
  - pause / resume
- **Stop (Finish Log)**:
  - fills `end`=now, computes `durationMin`
  - mini-review: quality (1–5, optional; hidden for life-maintenance)
  - save & close
- **Discard Log**: confirm, then delete the in-progress session.

**Error/Offline**
- If offline, persist to IndexedDB with `clientId`; sync later.
- If tab closes, autosave every 5s.

### B) Manual Entry (from Timeline or Quick Add)
1. Select range (drag on timeline or pick start/end).
2. Choose category; enter title; optional note; optional quality.
3. Save → creates a fixed session; timeline updates.

### C) Edit / Split / Merge
- **Edit**: opens Session Editor Sheet (time pickers, category select, note, quality).
- **Split**: choose split point; confirm → creates two sessions.
- **Merge**: select adjacent sessions with same category; confirm → single session.

---

## Timeline (Day & Week)
- **Day View**
  - 24h vertical grid; current time marker.
  - Unassigned gaps display shaded background with “log this time”.
  - Dragging creates a new block with start/end prefilled.
- **Week View**
  - Seven columns; blocks stacked per day.
  - Drag across days; resize on either side.
- **Conflict Resolution**
  - If overlap happens (via import or edit), show outline and “resolve” pill → choose which to trim or split.

---

## Insights

### Overview Cards (top)
- Total Logged (range)
- Average per Day
- Most-Time Category
- Unassigned Minutes

### Visualizations
1. **Daily Distribution (Stacked Bars)**
   - X = day; Y = minutes; stacks = categories.
   - Tooltip shows exact minutes and percentage per category.
2. **Mastery Progress (Radial per Skill)**
   - current quality-weighted hours / 10,000
   - projected mastery date using last 8-week rolling average.
3. **Hour × Category Heatmap**
   - 0–23 hours vs. categories; intensity = minutes.
4. **Streaks**
   - days achieving category weekly target.

### Filters & Controls
- Range picker (week, month, quarter, custom).
- Category multi-select w/ chips.
- Skills-only toggle.
- Include/Exclude Sleep & Food.

### AI Insight Tiles (optional, when enabled)
- “you spent 12h (+30%) on coding vs last week”
- “+4.3h/week on ML → mastery pulls into Aug 2029”

---

## Notes
- **Composer**: big textarea; link picker for related sessions.
- **Auto-link**: notes written during a running log link on save.
- **List**: reverse chrono; left color spine; duration badges; copy button.
- **Search**: full-text + filters (category, date range, tags).
- **Summaries**: AI generates day/week TL;DR and action items (optional).

---

## Categories
- **List Screen**:
  - row = dot + name + type badge + mastery toggle + Edit
- **Add / Edit Modal**:
  - name (text)
  - Type: skill, life-maintenance, admin, social/spiritual, other
  - Counts Toward Mastery (toggle)
  - color grid (stable mapping)
  - default weekly target (optional)
- **Archive**: archived categories hidden by default; can be restored.

---

## Settings
- **Account (Clerk)**: name, photo, email.
- **Preferences**: timezone, rounding (1/5/15), week start day, default log duration.
- **Targets**: per skill weekly targets.
- **AI**: enable summaries; show data usage note.
- **Data**: export CSV/JSON; import; delete account; backup snapshots.

---

## State & Error Handling
- Autosave notes and running logs every 5s.
- Offline Mode: banner + local queue; reconcile on reconnect (idempotent using `clientId`).
- Session Integrity: no zero or negative durations; guard with validation before save.
- Timezones: store UTC; render with user timezone; use date truncation with TZ in all aggregations.
- DST: display true local times; do not silently shift past entries.

---

## Analytics (Product Telemetry — optional)
- `session_started`, `session_finished`, `session_split`, `session_edited`
- `note_created`, `note_summarized`
- `category_created`, `category_toggled_mastery`
- `insights_viewed`, `filter_changed`

Include only anonymous, per-user metrics; never send note text without explicit AI opt-in.

## Data Contracts (Frontend ⇄ API)

### Session (`POST /api/session`)

```json
{
  "categoryId": "string",
  "title": "string",
  "start": "2025-04-26T14:05:00Z",
  "end": "2025-04-26T15:00:00Z",      // omit if live
  "durationMin": 55,                  // server recalculates
  "quality": 4,
  "tags": ["coding", "web"],
  "clientId": "uuid"                  // for offline sync
}
```

### Note (`POST /api/notes`)

```json
{
  "body": "string",
  "sessionIds": ["..."]               // optional
}
```

### Insights (`GET /api/insights/summary`)

Query: `granularity=day|week|month&from&to&categoryIds[]&skillsOnly&includeLife=true|false`

Response includes totals by category, unassigned minutes, rolling pace, and mastery projections.

## Keyboard Shortcuts (Global)
- S start/stop log
- P pause/resume
- N add note
- [ / ] decrease/increase 1 minute
- ⌘K quick add anywhere

Provide a help modal (?) listing these.

---

## Empty, Loading, and Error States
- **Timer empty**: “no active log. press start logging or open the timeline.”
- **Timeline empty day**: “no logs yet — drag to create your first block.”
- **Insights empty**: “log at least one day to see trends.”
- **Notes empty**: “write it down while it’s fresh.”
- **Loading**: skeleton bars/blocks; avoid spinners where skeletons work.
- **Errors**: inline message + retry button; never block navigation.

---

## Review Checklist Before Ship
- Sleep & Food can be logged without “focus” wording anywhere.
- 24h day view can be filled entirely; gaps are obvious and loggable.
- Category color mapping is consistent across list, timeline, notes, insights.
- Charts use flat fills; legends filter correctly.
- Keyboard shortcuts work; accessible numeric fallback for the dial.
- Autosave + offline retains logs on refresh or tab close.
- Export CSV reflects the same durations as charts.
- No gradients, glass, or soft blurs anywhere.
